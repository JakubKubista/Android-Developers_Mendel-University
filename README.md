The core Activity of program can be find in path: app\src\main\java\com\mendelu\vui_nim\GameActivity.java

Many lines of the code contains a lot of log messages for detail description what's happening in
the memory, so code is a little bit longer.

I have to say a big thank to Ing. Jan Kolomazn√≠k, Ph.D., who inspired me a lot.
